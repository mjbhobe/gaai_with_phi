basic_agent.py - basic Q&A with an LLM via Agno (PhiData) Agent

This application illustrated basic Q&A with an LLM (we will use
Google Gemini 2.0 Flash in this example, but you can use any
supported LLM). The LLM does not maintain any "chat history" nor
any context from RAG, nor use any tools. So all responses are
coming from it's pretrained knowledgebase only.

We have added some Mumbai flair - the responses from the LLM will
be using Mumbai-lingo (you'll get an explanation of the slang, don't worry boss!)
