"""
agent_with_memory_and_tools.py - adding web search capability (via tools) to
    our Q&A agent, with memory.

This example adds web search capability to the Q&A agent with memory, which we
coded in agent_with_memory.py. When you ask a question that the LLM cannot answer
from its pretrained knowledgebase, it will try and search the web to get additional
context that it can answer from. For websearch we'll use the DuckDuckGoTools.

As before, we'll be using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash as our LLM, but you can use any
supported LLM. The LLM is not yet equipped with any tools or additional knowledgebase
(such as that from RAG), so all responses are coming from it's pretrained knowledgebase.

We have added some Mumbai flair - the responses from the LLM will
be using Mumbai-lingo (you'll get an explanation of the slang, don't worry boss!)
